# Product Specification: E-Commerce Shopping Cart Application

## Project Overview
Build a modern, performant shopping cart application that enables users to browse products, add items to cart, and complete purchases. The application will prioritize user experience, performance, and reliability while following modern web development standards and best practices.

## Core Features
- Product Catalog & Browse
  - Paginated product listing with search and filters
  - Individual product detail pages
  - Real-time inventory status
  
- Shopping Cart Management
  - Add/remove items with quantity adjustment
  - Persistent cart state across sessions
  - Real-time price calculations and updates

- Checkout Process
  - Guest and authenticated checkout flows
  - Address & payment information collection
  - Order summary & confirmation

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Architecture
```typescript
// Core Technologies
- Next.js 14+ with App Router
- TypeScript 5.3+
- Tailwind CSS 3.4+
- React Server Components
- State Management: Zustand or Redux Toolkit

// Component Structure
/components
  /ui            // Reusable UI components
  /features      // Feature-specific components
  /layouts       // Layout components
  /hooks         // Custom React hooks
```

### Data Layer
```typescript
// Product Interface
interface Product {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  price: number;
  inventory: number;
  images: string[];
  categories: string[];
}

// Cart Interface
interface CartItem {
  productId: string;
  quantity: number;
  price: number;
}

interface Cart {
  items: CartItem[];
  total: number;
  userId?: string;
}
```

### API Endpoints
```typescript
// RESTful API Routes
GET    /api/products      // List products with pagination
GET    /api/products/:id  // Get single product
POST   /api/cart         // Add to cart
PUT    /api/cart/:itemId // Update cart item
DELETE /api/cart/:itemId // Remove from cart
POST   /api/checkout     // Process checkout
```

### Testing Strategy
- Jest unit tests for utilities and hooks
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Playwright for E2E testing of critical flows
- API endpoint testing with Supertest

## Acceptance Criteria

### Product Listing
- [ ] Products display in a responsive grid layout
- [ ] Each product shows image, name, price, and add-to-cart button
- [ ] Pagination works with 12 items per page
- [ ] Search filters products in real-time
- [ ] Product cards are keyboard accessible

### Shopping Cart
- [ ] Cart persists across page refreshes
- [ ] Quantity can be adjusted with immediate price updates
- [ ] Remove items functionality works
- [ ] Cart total updates automatically
- [ ] Empty cart state is handled gracefully

### Checkout Process
- [ ] Form validation for required fields
- [ ] Address verification
- [ ] Payment processing integration
- [ ] Order confirmation page
- [ ] Email confirmation sent

## Implementation Notes

### Performance Considerations
- Implement image optimization using Next.js Image component
- Use React Suspense for loading states
- Implement proper data caching strategy
- Optimize bundle size with dynamic imports

### Security Measures
- Input sanitization
- CSRF protection
- Rate limiting on API routes
- Secure payment processing
- Data encryption at rest

### Error Handling
- Implement global error boundary
- Proper API error responses
- Offline functionality
- Network error recovery

## Timeline Estimate

### Phase 1: Setup & Core Features (1 week)
- Project setup and configuration
- Basic product listing and detail pages
- Initial cart functionality

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features (1 week)
- Cart persistence
- Search and filtering
- Responsive design implementation

### Phase 3: Checkout & Testing (1 week)
- Checkout flow implementation
- Unit and E2E testing
- Performance optimization

### Phase 4: Polish & Deploy (3 days)
- Bug fixes
- Final testing
- Deployment and monitoring setup

Total Timeline: 3.5 weeks

Notes:
- Timeline assumes one full-time senior developer
- Includes buffer for code review and QA
- Does not include external dependencies (e.g., payment processing setup)
